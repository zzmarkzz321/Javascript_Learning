# Javascript_Learning
A collection of all the things I've learned while exploring Javascript!


## You're probably wondering, why? 
I personally find it easier to learn things when I apply it to real problems, projects, etc. 

## What you'll find..
In this repo, you will find a collection of projects (big or small), usages of some functions, design patterns, etc. All commented to describe why, how, and what I did.
